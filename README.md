## About

Tomo-SANS is a Python package for reconstructing 3D magnetization volumes using a small angle neutron scattering tomography algorithm developed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00023.pdf). The algorithm processes multi-projection small angle neutron scattering measurements to generate mean scattering feature reconstructions (MSFR) of the bulk spin textures. The free parameters are the external field, B, the saturation magnetization, M<sub>s</sub>, the average magnetization, <m<sub>z</sub>>, and a Zeeman weighting term, h.
